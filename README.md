# PHP Loose Typing and Null Comparisons
This example demonstrates an uncommon bug in PHP that can arise from loose typing and null comparisons.  When using `==` instead of `===` for null checks, PHP's type juggling behavior may lead to unexpected results.  The bug involves how `0` and `false` are handled in comparisons involving `null`.

The `bug.php` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version using strict comparison (`===`).
